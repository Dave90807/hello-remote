This is a *lesson* on remote Git repos from EdX.com course to verify understanding of working with remote features.

Some items are:
* git fetch
* git fetch origin
* git push
* git pull

But the use of Markdown is really shown here in this file, like:

1. here is an example of a 'Google.com' hyper link: [inline-style link](https://www.google.com)
2. Here is strong **emphasis** on a word.
3. One can also use __Underscores__ to draw attention.

### A Table Looks Like This

|  Table     | Are           |  Fun   |
| ---------- | :-----------: | -----: |
| Col 3 is   | right-aligned | $1     |
| Col 2 is   | centered      |$12     |
| zebra      | are           |neat    |

### Here Are Block Quotes

> Here is a Blockquotes and it is very hand in an email to emulate reply test.
> This line is part of the same quote.

### Wrapping Block Quote

> Here is an extremely long long long line of text that is typed into the editor on just one very very very long line.  But, when it is displayed in the resulting markdown window, it should wrap nicely onto multiple lines of text without any problem at all.  And by the way it is very easy to create inline **highlighted** text that is displayed within the block quote in markdown language.
